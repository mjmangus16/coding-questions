*** Steps to completing code challenge ***

1.  Set up a simple Go server on port 8081
    - Write a GET request that prints to page to test the server is working

2. Create a POST route that takes in a "count"
    - Write a simple test function that gets passed into the POST route.
        - For initial testing purposes, use the function to simply print the "count"

3. Add a 1 second sleep timer to the function so that it pauses for a second before it prints the "count"

4. A success message should be given once the function has completed running.

At this point the basic structure of the server and challenge should be completed. Once this
is running and has been tested we can move into figuring out the details of the challenge.
